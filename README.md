# Registration-form
I designed registration form for our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is fully functional, including user input, validation, and error messages to enhance the user experience.

Key Features:
1. User Input Validation: Ensuring all fields are completed with a 'Please fill out this field' message for required inputs.
2. Error Handling: If incorrect information is provided, the input box is highlighted in red, and a corresponding error message is displayed in red text.
